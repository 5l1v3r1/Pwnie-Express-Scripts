Pwn Plug Command Execution Using USB Sticks
===

http://www.securitygeneration.com/security/pwn-plug-command-execution-using-usb-sticks/

These files are to be used in conjunction with the tutorial found at the URL above. They allow you to run commands on the Pwnie Express PwnPlug by simply inserting a pre-configured USB stick.

Instructions

1. Format a USB stick with an ext3 filesystem. Note: format the entire device (sda, sdb) and not just a partition (sda1, sdb1):

  ```shell
  mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda (change this to your correct device)
  ```
2. Install udev and autofs:

  ```shell
  apt-get update && apt-get install udev autofs
  ```
3. Edit /etc/auto.master and append the following line:

  ```shell
  /var/autofs/removable /etc/auto.removable --timeout=2
  ```
4. Create /etc/auto.removable and copy in the following line:

  ```shell
  cmdusb -fstype=ext3 :/dev/cmdusb
  ```
5. Create /etc/udev/rules.d/custom.rules and add the following line:

  ```shell
  KERNEL=="sd?", SUBYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{model}=="*", SYMLINK+="cmdusb%n", RUN+="/bin/sh /usr/local/bin/cmdusb.sh"
  ```

  *Side note: If you want to only allow one specific USB drive to be used to run commands, enter your USB device’s model into the ATTRS{model} value above (instead of the wildcard). You can obtain your USB stick’s ID by running the following command (it’ll look something like: ATTRS{model}==”Flash Disk“), make sure your correct device is used (sda or sdb):
  ```shell
  udevadm info -a -p /sys/block/sda | grep model
  ```
6. Copy the [cmdusb.sh](cmdusb.sh) script to /usr/local/bin/cmdusb.sh, and edit it to set a custom long secret value (if required). Setting a secret will require that secret value to be present in a file called ‘secret’ in the root of the USB drive, otherwise commands will not be executed.
